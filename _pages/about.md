## My Research Interests

I am interested in how alterations to hydrological connectivity and vegetation communities can mitigate land degradation issues, with a primary focus on understanding how restoring natural habitat structure and function can reduce soil erosion and alter carbon dynamics. I take an interdisciplinary approach to monitoring structural and functional change, combining fieldwork and laboratory analysis with proximal and remote sensing technologies, and geospatial analysis, delivering both a spatial and temporal understanding of environmental change.

I am currently conducting research in support of the South West Peatland Partnership's Nature for Climate Project. We will be combining field measurements of hydrology and carbon fluxes with remote and proximally sensing data, to build an understanding of trajectories of change following peatland restoration. For more information on this and my previous research, please see my 'Research' tab.

## My Background

An interest in understanding our interactions with and impacts on the natural environment led me to a BSc in Environmental Science, at Griffith University. Through pursuing the 'natural resource science' major I developed a particular interest in the use of natural processes to mitigate land degradation and catchment management issues. I then went on to enrol in the Griffith School of Environment Honours Program, wherein my research formed part of an academic and industry based project, investigating the suitability of phytocovers for landfill management, in Australia.

Following my undergraduate studies, I spent two years working as a Research Technician for Professor Richard Brazier and his team, at the University of Exeter. During this time I worked on the South West Water funded ‘Mires Restoration Project’ and on a Wessex Water funded project investigating the impact of moorland restoration on water quality in Nutscale Reservoir.

In 2018 I finished a PhD in Physical Geography, at the University of Exeter. My PhD explored some of the multiple techniques available for developing an understanding of soil erosion in the UK, and was supported by the Defra-funded research project: SP1311 - Piloting a cost-effective framework for monitoring soil erosion in England and Wales.
